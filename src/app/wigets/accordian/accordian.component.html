                          The story begins as Don Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia family, overseeshis daughter's wedding. His beloved son ichael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's business. T hrough Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear.

                          Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The_Godfather parallels the young Vito Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The_Godfather's depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows.
